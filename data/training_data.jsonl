{"prompt": "What does a technician inspect on liftgate tires during a PM?", "response": "The technician inspects tread depth, tire condition, inflation levels, and ensures hub oil levels are adequate. They also check wheel damage, missing hardware, and verify wheel torque."}
{"prompt": "What is checked during the liftgate's front exterior inspection?", "response": "Technicians check the registration, VIN match, glad hand seals, air fittings, cord sockets, and marker lights. They also verify ABS function and front decals or panels."}
{"prompt": "What should be reviewed on the left side of a trailer during inspection?", "response": "The left side inspection covers body panels, rivets, reflective tape, mud flaps, huck bolts, and wheel bearings. Side marker lights are checked for securement and functionality."}
{"prompt": "What does a rear trailer inspection include?", "response": "Rear inspection involves checking license plates, rear lights, placards, outer doors, dock bumpers, reflective tape, and ensuring door mechanisms like latches and cables are functional."}
{"prompt": "What’s part of the right side trailer inspection?", "response": "Similar to the left, the right side inspection includes mud flaps, marker lights, skirts, huck bolts, and panel condition. It also includes air drain cords and cable routing."}
{"prompt": "What is inspected in the chassis section of the liftgate?", "response": "Technicians inspect crossmembers, wiring harnesses, suspension welds, brake chambers, landing gear grease points, and overall brake system integrity including slack adjusters and brake shoes."}
{"prompt": "What are interior inspection points for a liftgate trailer?", "response": "Interior inspections include checking floor integrity, inner wall condition, D-rings, door track and rollers, Safe Stack system, and hydraulic components for leaks."}
{"prompt": "How is the liftgate operation validated?", "response": "Technicians verify the liftgate raises and lowers smoothly without grinding or chatter. Hinges, safety locks, and hydraulic performance are checked, along with battery load test and switch response."}
{"prompt": "Why is it important to log brake stroke measurements?", "response": "Logging free and applied brake stroke ensures regulatory compliance and early detection of mechanical wear, reducing risk of brake failure in transit."}
{"prompt": "What’s included in the final admin section of a PM inspection?", "response": "The technician completes the FAI form, applies the updated sticker, logs tire PSI and tread depths, checks for recalls, and confirms all findings are recorded for audit."}
{"prompt": "What should be checked during a light-duty vehicle PMA inspection?", "response": "A PMA inspection includes reviewing fluid levels, tire condition, brake pads, lighting, and windshield wipers. The technician also checks for warning lights and documents mileage."}
{"prompt": "What is included in a heavy-duty truck PM checklist?", "response": "Heavy-duty inspections focus on brakes, suspension, frame integrity, air lines, and electrical systems. Inspectors also verify VINs, lights, reflective tape, and coupling components."}
{"prompt": "What items are reviewed during a forklift inspection?", "response": "Forklift checks include tire wear, forks, lift chains, hydraulic leaks, safety belts, horn, brakes, and overhead guards. Electrical and fluid systems must be tested for safety."}
{"prompt": "What is checked in a power unit PM sheet?", "response": "Power unit inspections cover engine performance, oil levels, air filters, transmission fluid, fan belts, battery condition, and check engine light diagnostics."}
{"prompt": "How is trailer suspension evaluated?", "response": "Trailer suspension is inspected by checking the leaf springs, airbag condition, torque arm welds, hangers, and for any cracks in the suspension brackets."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the FAI form in inspections?", "response": "The FAI (Federal Annual Inspection) form documents DOT compliance. It must be signed by a certified technician and covers safety-critical components like brakes, tires, and lighting."}
{"prompt": "What is the correct air pressure for trailer tires?", "response": "Trailer tires should be inflated to 100 PSI. Tires below 80 PSI are considered deflated and must be aired up or replaced."}
{"prompt": "What should be done if reflective tape is peeling?", "response": "If reflective tape is peeling or damaged, it should be completely removed and replaced to maintain DOT visibility standards."}
{"prompt": "What does a dock bumper inspection involve?", "response": "Dock bumpers must be securely mounted with no missing bolts, excessive wear, or corner cracks. Damage can affect trailer docking safety."}
{"prompt": "What is checked in a liftgate battery inspection?", "response": "Technicians check the battery date code, load test results, cable tightness, and the physical condition of the battery box and terminals."}
{"prompt": "Why is it important to test ABS function during a trailer inspection?", "response": "ABS testing ensures that the anti-lock braking system is operational, which prevents wheel lockup and improves braking safety."}
{"prompt": "What information is required on a completed PM inspection form?", "response": "A PM form must include unit number, technician signature, date of inspection, mileage, and a checklist of components reviewed."}
{"prompt": "What is the procedure for inspecting trailer mud flaps?", "response": "Mud flaps are inspected for cracks, secure mounting, missing cotter pins, and bracket weld integrity. Broken mud flaps can result in DOT violations."}
{"prompt": "How do you inspect trailer air tanks?", "response": "Inspect air tanks for soft spots, rust, pinholes, and leaks. Ensure air valves are secure and free from rubbing or chafed hoses."}
{"prompt": "How is brake stroke measured?", "response": "Brake stroke is measured in inches from the released to the applied position. Excessive stroke may indicate a need for adjustment or component wear."}
{"prompt": "What is the procedure for checking side marker lights?", "response": "Ensure side marker lights are securely mounted, properly illuminated, and free of cracks. Non-functioning lights must be replaced before the vehicle is road-ready."}
{"prompt": "What do inspectors look for on a trailer door inspection?", "response": "Inspectors check door latches, cotter pins, cables, decals, and reflective tape. Damaged doors or missing safety components must be repaired immediately."}
{"prompt": "What is the function of a Safe Stack system?", "response": "The Safe Stack system helps secure cargo. Inspectors ensure tracks, beams, and feet are operational and not bent, rusted, or missing."}
{"prompt": "How often should a trailer be PM inspected?", "response": "Preventive maintenance inspections should be conducted every 90 days or 10,000 miles, depending on usage and company policy."}
{"prompt": "What are signs of wear in a trailer's axle or bearings?", "response": "Signs include excessive heat, grease leakage, unusual noises, and visible damage to bearing seals or spindles."}
